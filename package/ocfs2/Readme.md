## Rancher OCFS2 Filesystem Volume Plugin Driver

Mount an OCFS2 filesystem for shared usage

### Requirements

* Network IP address and hostname for each node (private network recommended)
* Pre-partitioned and OCFS2-formatted block device attached to each node at the same location (ex. `/dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:03:00.0-scsi-0:0:1:0-part1` or `/dev/disk/by-label/rancher-ocfs2`)

An OCFS2 filesystem can be created in Ubuntu 16.04 or this container.
A recommended command to create one using this container might be:
```
$ docker run -it --rm --privileged -v /dev:/host/dev romracer/storage-ocfs2:v0.6.6 /bin/bash
# mount --rbind /host/dev /dev
# parted --script /dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:03:00.0-scsi-0:0:1:0 \
    mklabel gpt \
    mkpart primary 1MiB 100\%
# mkfs.ocfs2 -N 16 -L rancher-ocfs2 -T mail --fs-features=sparse,backup-super,unwritten,inline-data,xattr,indexed-dirs -M cluster /dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:03:00.0-scsi-0:0:1:0-part1
# exit
```
You might need to re-read the block device on your nodes now:
```
# blockdev --rereadpt /dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:03:00.0-scsi-0:0:1:0
```

### Limitations

* A maximum of 16 nodes is supported

### OCFS2 filesystem plugin driver is a bash script and invocation commands are:
**Create:**  
```
driver  create json_options
```

**Delete:**  
```
driver  delete json_options
```

**Mount:**
```
driver  mount  mountpoint  json_options
```

**Unmount:**
```
driver  unmount  mountpoint
```

**Other Functions:**  
attach, detach functions don't do anything.  

### Usage
Rancher hosts will have default backing device environment variable set identifying default block device.  Driver will use it to mount OCFS2 filesystem and create a directory for each volume during create command and delete it at delete command.

For instance:
```
export BACKING_DEVICE=/dev/disk/by-label/rancher-ocfs2
```

##### Create command
user supplies volume name, driver creates a directory under default mount point using volume name.
The output is the status and newly created directory name

```
./ocfs2 create '{"name":"vol1"}'

name represents volume name.

stdout output: {"status": "Success”,"options":{"created":true,"name":"vol1”}}

the options map from the output will be passed in as part of json_input for delete command
```

##### Delete command
driver deletes created directory at create phase

```
./ocfs2 delete '{"mntDest":"/home/ubuntu/mnt", "created":"true", "name":"vol1"}'

the options map from create command output is passed in to delete command as part of json_input

stdout output: {"status":"Success","message":""}
```

#### Mount command
driver bind mounts OCFS2 source directory created at create command phase

```
./ocfs2 mount /home/ubuntu/mnt '{"name":"vol1"}'

name is a must

stdout output: {"status":"Success","message":""}
```

#### Unmount command
driver unmount OCFS2 bind mount

```
./ocfs2 unmount /home/ubuntu/mnt

stdout output: {"status":"Success","message":""}
```
